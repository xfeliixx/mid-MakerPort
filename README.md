# mid-MakerPort

### MakerPort is an interdisciplinary project, with the task of creating a platform for the management of space, equipment and educational resources available to a new lab at the University of Osnabr√ºck. It consists of an app for students and a management panel for administrators.
We implemented the booking flow of the MakerPort to test an AI Time Slot System developed by the computer science students.
